# VWAP Options pricer

The material in this repository belongs to my honours project in Mathematical Finance during 2011.
I was working based on the implementation of Dr Tim Ling's option pricing header that use GNU gsl library and Boost.
In the current version, GNU gsl has been fully removed the standard library header <random>.

If you turn out to make any use of it. Please do cite the repository :)

## Compiler requirement

* Clang 10 (This is compiler I use over my CLION IDE on a Linux UBUNTU 20.4. One can certainly go with GCC or MSVC)
